This repository containes sources of an Arch Linux (pacman) package, see [PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD) for details. Being opinionated and special-purpose, it is not published on the AUR (Arch User Repository), but instead is part of a [collection of atomic configuration snippets](https://github.com/regaur) I use to build Arch-based systems.
